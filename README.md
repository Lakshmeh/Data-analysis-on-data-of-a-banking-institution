# Data-analysis-on-data-of-a-banking-institution

Data of a banking institution was provided using which data analysis and further prediction was made if a customer will buy term deposits in future or not.

To solve the given problem statement, I had to first analyse the data provided and find
valuable insights.
Some valuable insights I figured were:
1) 88% of customers did not subscribe for term deposits and 12% of customers
subscribed for the term deposits.
2) Average age of people subscribed to term deposit > average age of people not
subscribed to term deposit
3) Campaigning for those who subscribed is less
4) Pdays of those who subscribed is more than those who haven't subscribed
5) Calls made previously before campaigning for those who subscribed is higher
6) Call duration is significantly higher for people who subscribed
7) Bank balance of people who subscribed is higher.
8) Calls made before campaigning are crucial.
9) People who have studied secondary education and tertiary education seem to have
maximum subscribers
10) Married and single people are subscribing more.
11) Those who don't have housing loans subscribed to term deposits more.
12) 30-40 is the age range of max customers.
13) Significant difference when it comes to personal loan. those who don't have a
personal loan went for a term deposit more.
An ML model is then created and deployed to predict if customers will subscribe for term
deposits in future.
